Hi there Users!<br />
I am glad that you are here!<br />
This is my first project so pardon me for any errors. So about this project:-<br />
This is JARVIS, your personal assistant in command line! It is completely based on python. I have also provided an
virtualenv named env. If you dont know how to use it you can also use the run.ps1(for powershell) or run.cmd(for command
prompt) scripts. This assistant is currently supported only for windows as i dont have any linux pc. You dont need to install
python to run this assistant. You can use the env. But if you want to, than install python 3, as this project is made with python 3.<br />
This assistant currently have following features:-<br />
--->1)Wish the user!<br />

--->4)Play songs<br />

--->9)Search on google<br />
--->10)Search on youtube<br />
